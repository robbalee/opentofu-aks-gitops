# OpenTofu AKS GitOps Implementation

## Project Description

This project implements a production-ready Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using OpenTofu (formerly Terraform) for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Flux for GitOps automation. The implementation follows cloud-native best practices for secure, scalable, and maintainable Kubernetes infrastructure on Azure.

### Key Components

1. **OpenTofu for Infrastructure as Code**: Using OpenTofu to declaratively define and provision Azure infrastructure resources including the AKS cluster, networking, and security components.

2. **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**: Managed Kubernetes service on Azure providing the platform for container orchestration.

3. **Flux GitOps**: GitOps implementation using Flux to manage Kubernetes resources, ensuring that cluster state always matches the desired state defined in Git repositories.

4. **Azure Integration**: Leveraging Azure services such as Azure Monitor, Azure Container Registry, and Azure Key Vault for a complete cloud-native solution.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup with OpenTofu

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - `/infrastructure`: OpenTofu configurations
   - `/kubernetes`: Kubernetes manifests for Flux management
   - `/scripts`: Utility scripts for deployment and management

2. **Network Architecture**:
   - Define Virtual Network (VNet) and subnets
   - Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs)
   - Set up Azure Private Link for secure connectivity

3. **AKS Cluster Provisioning**:
   - Deploy AKS with node pools configuration
   - Configure Azure CNI networking
   - Enable managed identities for enhanced security
   - Set up Azure Monitor integration for observability

4. **Supporting Resources**:
   - Azure Container Registry for container images
   - Azure Key Vault for secrets management
   - Storage accounts for persistent storage

### Phase 2: GitOps Implementation with Flux

1. **Flux Installation**:
   - Deploy Flux controllers and components to the AKS cluster
   - Configure Flux to watch Git repositories

2. **GitOps Repository Structure**:
   - `/clusters`: Cluster-specific configurations
   - `/apps`: Application deployments
   - `/infrastructure`: Infrastructure components (ingress controllers, cert-manager, etc.)
   - `/base`: Base configurations and common resources

3. **Continuous Delivery Setup**:
   - Define Flux Kustomizations for different environments
   - Configure Flux notifications for deployment status
   - Implement promotion workflow between environments

### Phase 3: Operational Considerations

1. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for metrics
   - Set up Azure Monitor for container insights
   - Configure logging with Azure Log Analytics

2. **Security Measures**:
   - Network Policy implementation
   - Pod security policies and standards
   - Secret management with Azure Key Vault integration

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:
   - Implement OpenTofu validation in CI pipelines
   - Configure automated testing for infrastructure changes
   - Set up continuous integration for Kubernetes manifests

### Phase 4: Documentation and Handover

1. **Documentation**:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Deployment procedures
   - Operational runbooks
   - Security considerations

2. **Training**:
   - GitOps workflow training
   - OpenTofu management procedures
   - Kubernetes operations training
